\section{Introduction}

\noindent
LEMA has been developed for the formal verification of analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits.  LEMA includes the following tools: 

\begin{itemize}
\item LHPN Editor - a tool to create a model using the 
\emph{labeled hybrid Petri net} (LHPN) format.\\ 
The LHPN format is described in
%%tth:\begin{html}<A HREF="http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/publications">\end{html}
David Walter and Scott Little's PhD dissertations
%%tth:\begin{html}</A>\end{html}
(UofUtah 2007/2008).
\item Verification tool - a tool to perform model checking on a LHPN model.  The tool can use DBM, BDD, or SMT to represent the state space.
These model checkers are described in
%%tth:\begin{html}<A HREF="http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/publications">\end{html}
David Walter and Scott Little's PhD dissertations
%%tth:\begin{html}</A>\end{html}
(UofUtah 2007/2008).
\item Learn tool - a tool to generate LHPN, VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS models from simulation data.\\
This tool is described in 
%%tth:\begin{html}<A HREF="http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/publications">\end{html}
Scott Little's PhD Dissertation
%%tth:\begin{html}</A>\end{html}
(UofUtah 2008).
\item TSD Graph Editor- a tool to visualize TSD files. 
% \item Probability Graph Editor - a tool to visualize probability data. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Management}

\noindent
A project is a collection of models, analysis views, learn
views, and graphs.  As shown below, {\tt LEMA} displays all project
files on the left, the open models, views, and graphs on the
right, and a log of all external commands on the bottom.
The menu bar is located on the top of the window in the Windows and
Linux versions.  It is located on the top of the screen in the MacOS version.
\begin{center}

\end{center}

\subsection{Creating and Opening Projects}

\noindent
To create a new project, select New $\rightarrow$ Project from the File
menu as shown below. You will then be prompted to browse to a desired location
and to give a name to the project directory. After you do this,
click the new button and a new project directory will be created.
To open a project, select Open $\rightarrow$ Project from the File menu.
You will then be prompted to browse to a project directory to
open, and clicking open will open the project. You may also open
a project by selecting one of your five most recently opened
projects by selecting the project name shown in the File drop
down menu shown below. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=50mm]{screenshots/projectLema}
\end{center}

\subsection{Creating Models and Graphs}

\noindent
After you have created or opened a project, you can create a
new model or graph to add to the project.  To create a new 
VHDL-AMS model, select  New $\rightarrow$ VHDL-AMS Model from the
File menu as shown below. You will then be prompted to give a model id. At this
point, a simple text editor will open in a new tab. To create a new LHPN model 
(see Section~\ref{LHPN}), select New $\rightarrow$ Labeled Hybrid Petri Net from
the File menu. You will then be prompted to give a model id.  At this point, an
LHPN editor (see Section~\ref{LHPNEdit}) will open in a new tab. To create a new
Spice model, select New $\rightarrow$ Spice Circuit from the File menu.  You
will then be prompted to give a model id.  At this point, a simple text editor
will open in a new tab.  To create a new TSD graph, select New $\rightarrow$ TSD
Graph from the File menu. You will then
be prompted to give a name to the TSD graph.  At this point, a TSD graph editor
(see Section~\ref{TSDEdit}) will open in a new tab.   Once a model or graph is 
created, it can be opened again later by right clicking on the object in the
project window and selecting ``Edit'', or alternatively
double-clicking on the object.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=45mm]{screenshots/newModelLema}
\end{center}

\subsection{Importing Models}

\noindent
You can import into the current working project VHDL-AMS models
or LHPNs created by other programs or stored in other projects. 
To import a VHDL-AMS model, select Import $\rightarrow$ VHDL-AMS Model
from the File menu as shown below. You will then be able to browse to
find a model to import.  After  selecting the desired model, click the 
import button to bring the model into the project. 
To import an LHPN, the procedure is the same except use the 
Import $\rightarrow$ LHPN Model option.  Before bringing the model
into the project, it will be edited to a format consistent with this tool.  
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=45mm]{screenshots/importLema}
\end{center} 

\subsection{Editing Project Objects}

\noindent
All project objects can be modified by highlighting the object
and using a right mouse click to open a menu of options as shown
below. Using this menu, every type of object can be copied, renamed, or
deleted. For an LHPN, the ``View/Edit'' option opens the
model in an LHPN editor (see Section~\ref{LHPNEdit}). For a VHDL-AMS model,
the ``View/Edit'' option opens the model in a simple text editor. For a TSD
graph, the ``View/Edit'' 
option opens the TSD graph in a TSD graph editor (see Section~\ref{TSDEdit}). 
For a probability graph, the ``View/Edit'' option opens
the probability graph in a histogram editor 
(see Section~\ref{ProbEdit}). 
For a verification view, the ``Open Verification View'' option opens the
verification view (see Section~\ref{Verification}). For a learn view, the
``Open Learn View'' option opens the learn view (see Section~\ref{Learn}).

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Viewing Project Objects}

\noindent
An LHPN can also be viewed using 
%%tth:\begin{html}<A HREF="http://www.graphviz.org/">\end{html}
GraphViz's
%%tth:\begin{html}</A>\end{html}
dotty program  by right clicking on the model you want to view and
selecting the ``View Model'' option. A VHDL-AMS model may be converted into an
LHPN and viewed using the same ``View Model'' option.

\includegraphics[height=35mm]{screenshots/modVerify} & &
\includegraphics[height=35mm]{screenshots/modLearnLema}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Creating Tool Views}

\noindent
To perform verification or learning, right click on a model and
select ``Create Verification View'' (see Section~\ref{Verification})to perform
analysis or ``Create Learn View'' (see Section~\ref{Learn})
to perform learning. A verification or learn view may also be opened by
selecting the model in the file tree and selecting Learn or Verification from
the Tools menu.  You will then be prompted to give a name to
your verification or learn view. After a name is entered, a tab with
the newly created view will open. Once a view is created, it can
be opened again later by right clicking on an analysis directory
and selecting ``Open Verification/Learn View'' or alternatively
double-clicking on the view.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics[height=55mm]{screenshots/createVerification} & & 
\includegraphics[height=55mm]{screenshots/createLearnLema}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When you create a verification view from a VHDL model, an LHPN is
automatically created for verification.

\section{\label{LHPNEdit}LHPN Editor}

\noindent
The LHPN editor as shown below allows the user to create or modify an LHPN
model of an analog or mixed-signal circuit.  An LHPN model includes
places (see Section~\ref{places}),
transitions (see Section~\ref{transitions}), 
variables (see Section~\ref{variables}), and
control flow (see Section~\ref{controlFlow}).
Each of these items can be added, removed, or edited. 
To add a new item, click on the appropriate add button. You
will then be prompted to provide a unique id and some properties
for this new item (as described below). After you have filled out
all of the required fields, click add and the new item will be
added to the LHPN.
To remove an item from the model, select that item and click
the remove button. The item will then be removed from the model.
However, if you try to remove an item that is being used 
(for example, a variable that is assigned in a transition), you will first have 
to remove its use.
To edit an existing item, select that item from the list and
click the edit button. An editing window will open and you will
be able to change the properties of that item. When you are done
editing this item, click save to save the changes to the item. 
After the model is complete, press the Save LHPN button to store
the model. The Save As button can also be used to store the
model, but in this case, a new model ID will be requested and the
model will be saved using that ID. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=90mm]{screenshots/LHPNedit}
\end{center}

\subsection{\label{places}Places}

\noindent
Places define a certain characteristic of a circuit, according to the
definition of Petri nets.  It may be noted that the LEMA tool does not support
implicit places in its LHPNs.  If an LHPN with implicit places is imported into
the tool, the implicit places are automatically explicitly declared in the
imported net. 
As shown below, a place has the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item ID: a unique ID composed of only alphanumeric characters and 
      underscores.
\item Initial Marking: a boolean describing whether the place is initially marked.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/place}
\end{center}

\subsection{\label{transitions}Transitions}

\noindent
Transitions define events in the petri nets.  In the case of LHPNs, they are 
elaborated by labels attached to the transitions, which are defined by included
fields.
As shown below, a transition has the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item ID: a unique ID composed of only alphanumeric characters and 
       underscores.
\item Delay Lower Bound: the minimum amount of time that the transition can wait
       after it is enabled before it fires.  This can be written as an 
       expression.
\item Delay Upper Bound: the maximum amount of time that the transition can wait
       after it is enabled before it fires.  This can also be an expression.
\item Transition Rate: an exponential function expressing the probability that
       the transition will fire.  this is currently not enabled but will be
       included in later releases.
\item Enabling Condition: the condition that must evaluate to true in order for
       the transition to be enabled.
\item Assignments: assignments to boolean, continuous and integer variables.
       This also includes rate assignments to continuous variables. This list
       is edited using the ``Add Assignment'', ``Edit Assignment'', and
       ``Remove Assignment'' buttons.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=65mm]{screenshots/transition}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{\label{assignments}Assignments}
\noindent
When an assignment is added to the labeling function of a transition, the user
is prompted to define the assignment that is to take place.  An assignment may
be made to the value of any variable or to the rate of a continuous variable.
An assignment consists of the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item Variable: the variable that is being assigned.
\item Assignment Lower Bound: the lowest value that the assigned value can take.
       This may be defined in terms of an expression parseable by ATACS.
\item Assignment Upper Bound: the greatest value that the assigned value can 
       take.  This also may be defined in terms of an expression.
\item Rate Assignment: whether or not the assignment is being made to the value
       or rate of a continuous variable (Note: this field is disabled for
       non-continous variables).
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=65mm]{screenshots/assignment}
\end{center}

\subsection{\label{variables}Variables}

\noindent
Variables represent the continuous, boolean, or integer signals used in an LHPN.
When a variable is created, the user will be prompted to input which type of
variable is being created.
As shown below, a variable contains the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item ID: a unique ID composed only of alphanumeric characters and 
       underscores.
\item Initial Lower Bound: the lower bound of the variable's initial value.
\item Initial Upper Bound: the upper bound of the variable's initial value.
\item Mode: whether the variable is an inpout or an output to the circuit
       (Note: only available for boolean variables).
\item Rate Lower Bound: the lower bound of the variable's initial rate 
       (Note: only available for continuous variables).
\item Rate Upper Bound: the upper bound of the variable's initial rate
       (Note: only available for continuous variables).
\end{itemize}
To change a variable from one type to another, the user must remove the initial
variable and then add a new variable with the same id of the desired type.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=70mm]{screenshots/contVariable}
\includegraphics[height=35mm]{screenshots/boolVariable}
\includegraphics[height=35mm]{screenshots/intVariable}
\end{center}

\subsection{\label{controlFlow}Control Flow}

\noindent
The control flow describes the edges in the LPN, or the connections between
places and transitions.  The edges in the net are referred to as ``movements''
within the tool and describe a directional edge between nodes of the graph.
As shown below, a movement includes the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item From: the place or transition at the leading end of the edge, i.e. where
       the movement originates.
\item To: the place or transition  (of the type not used in the From field) at
       the trailing end of the edge.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{screenshots/movement}
\end{center}

\section{\label{TextEdit}Text Editor}

\noindent
A simple text editor is available for viewing VHDL-AMS models and spice decks.
This editor does not have many features, so the user may desire to use a  more
robust external text editor.  To do so, select the Preferences option from the
Edit menu, click on the ``Use External Viewer'' option and enter the name of
the desired external text editor in the space provided.  Every time that a 
VHDL-AMS or Spice model is opened, it will be opened in the external text 
editor.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/VHDLedit}
\end{center}
\clearpage

\section{\label{Verification}Verification View}

\noindent
The verification view is used to verify the property stated in the LHPN model.
 The verification view as shown below includes tabs for 
basic options (see Section~\ref{basOptions}),  and
advanced options (see Section~\ref{advOptions}).
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/verificationView}
\end{center}

\subsection{\label{basOptions}Basic Options}

\noindent
This tab includes the model being verified, basic timing options, and other
basic user options.
<ADD CITATION?> 

The first line on the basic options panel is the filename of the LHPN being
verified.  The LHPN verified is the one saved in the file location at the time
of verification.

The first set of radio buttons in this tab specifies the
timing method to be used in the verification.
\begin{itemize}
\item BDD specifies binary decision diagram modeling.

\end{itemize}

The other advanced options include
\begin{itemize}
\item No checks [NEEDS DESCRIPTION]
\item Reduction [NEEDS DESCRIPTION]
\item BDD Linkspace Size [NEEDS DESCRIPTION]
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/advOptions}
\end{center}

\section{\label{Learn}Learn View}

\noindent
The learn view is used to generate an LHPN from time series data. The learn 
view includes tabs for a data manager (see Section~\ref{dataManager}), 
a learn tool (see Section~\ref{learnTool}), and a 
TSD graph editor (see Section~\ref{TSDEdit}).

\subsection{\label{dataManager}Data Manager}

\noindent
The data manager as shown below is used to both enter time series
experimental data as well as bring data
into the learn view.  The Add button is used to create a new data
file. After pressing this button, enter the name of the new data
file, and then enter the data for this file using the data editor
to the right.  The Remove button deletes all highlighted files.
Note that after highlighting one file, you can use the ctrl key
to highlight additional files or the shift key to highlight a
range of files.  The Rename button is used to change the name of a
data file. The Copy button copies a data file. The Copy From View
button brings up a list of all analysis and learn views in the
current project, and data from the selected view will be copied
into this learn view.  Finally, the Import button brings up a file
browser, and it allows you to import a data file from outside
this project.  These files can be in time series data (TSD) format
(see Section~\ref{TSD}), comma separated value (CSV) format, or tab
delimited format (DAT). 

The contents of the data file highlighted on the left appear in the
data editor on the right.  Individual data entries can be modified,
new data points can be added using the Add Data Point button, data 
points can be removed using the Remove Data Point button, and data
points can be copied using the Copy Data Point button.  When you are
satisfied with all your changes, you should press the Save button
to record your changes.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=85mm]{screenshots/dataManagerLema}
\end{center}

\clearpage

\subsection{\label{learnTool}Learn Tool}

\noindent
The learn tool is used to generate abstract models from the 
simulation data entered through the data manager described above. To 
use this learn tool, adjust the basic options(see Section 
~\ref{learnBasOptions}) and advanced options(see Section 
~\ref{learnAdvOptions}), if desired, then press the Save and Learn button. 
The resulting abstract models in the form of Labeled Hybrid Petri Net
 (see Section~\ref{LHPN}),VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS can be viewed by 
clicking appropriate options in the View Menu. The resulting circuit is 
specified using our Labeled Hybrid Petri Net Format (see Section~\ref{LHPN})
 and is shown graphically using GraphViz's Dotty tool.  There are also 
menu options to save the parameters without learning, view the last learned 
models, save the generated models into the project, and view the last run
log. 

\subsubsection{\label{learnBasOptions}Basic Options}

The learning options shown below are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Iterations of Optimization Algorithm (default=10): \\
sets the number of iterations that will be run of the optimization algorithm 
used when the bins are automatically generated.  More iterations can improve 
the generated bin levels but can also substantially increase run time.
\item Number of Bins (default=4): \\
The number of bins value specifies how many values the
encoded time series data can assume.
\item Assertion to be Verified: \\
The property that the generated LHPN must satisfy has to be provided
in this field. This is the property that would be verified by the
Verification tool.
\item Equal Data Per Bins / Equal Spacing of Bins: \\
This radio button selects whether the auto generated levels
should be determined by equaling dividing the data between the
bins or by equally dividing the range of the data. 
\item Use Auto Generated Levels / Use User Generated Levels: \\
This radio button allows the user to select whether they want
the levels separating the bins to be auto generated or the user
would like to provide them. 
\item When using user provided levels, the Suggest Levels
button will provide the levels that would have been auto
generated as a suggestion. These levels can then edited by the
user.  The number of bins for each species can also be individually adjusted.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=85mm]{screenshots/learnBasicLema}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{\label{learnAdvOptions}Advanced Options}

\noindent
The following parameters which are used to configure the model generation 
process can be specified through the advanced options tab.
\begin{itemize}
\item Windowsize(default = -1) : \\Rates are calculated between points 
that are separated by the number of points specified in this field.If 
window size = -1, then rates are calculated using just the starting and
 ending points of the bins.
\item Pathlength(default = 15): \\If Windowsize = -1, then pathlength 
specifies the minimum number of consecutive timepoints which should be
 in the same region for that region to be eligible for rate calculation.
\item Epsilon(default = 0.1): \\ A variable is considered to be constant
 if it is within the epsilon bound of a value for certain time.
\item Absolute Time: \\ This checkbox determines whether a variable is 
considered constant based on the amount of time or based on the number
 of time points it stays within the epsilon bound.
\item DMVC Run Time(default = 5us): \\ If absolute time is checked, DMVC
 run time(described in 
%%tth:\begin{html}<A HREF="http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/publications">\end{html}
Scott Little's PhD Dissertation
%%tth:\begin{html}</A>\end{html} 
)determines the minimum duration for which a variable has to be
 constant so as to ensure that this duration is added to the total time 
where the variable is constant. 
\item DMVC Run Length(default = 15): \\ If absolute time is not selected,
 DMVC run length determines the minimum number of timepoints for which a
 variable has to be constant so as to ensure that this duration is added
 to the total time where the variable is constant. 
\item Fraction(default = 0.8): \\ A decimal value representing the fraction
 of the total trace that must be constant for the variable to qualify to 
be Discrete multi-valued continuous(DMVC).
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=85mm]{screenshots/learnAdvLema}
\end{center}

\section{\label{TSDEdit}TSD Graph Editor}

\noindent
The TSD graph editor appears as a tab in the learn
view.  TSD graphs can also be created at the top-level of the project
to allow you to integrate results from several learn
views. These graphs can be created using the New $\rightarrow$ TSD Graph
menu option. Once created, they can be viewed and edited by double
clicking on the graph in the project window.  An example graph is
shown below.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/TSDgraphLema}
\end{center}

In the TSD graph editor shown below,
a graph is created by double clicking on the graph. You can then set
various parameters and select what values you would like to have
graphed. The parameters that you can select for a graph include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Title - The title of the graph.
\item X-Axis Label - The label displayed for the x-axis. 
\item Y-Axis Label - The label displayed for the y-axis. 
\item X-Min - The starting value for the x-axis. 
\item X-Max - The ending value for the x-axis. 
\item X-Step - The increment for the x-axis. 
\item Y-Min - The starting value for the y-axis. 
\item Y-Max - The ending value for the y-axis. 
\item Y-Step - The increment for the y-Axis. 
\item Auto Resize Check Box -
Determines whether to automatically resize the graph for best fit. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/editGraphLema}
\end{center}

The data selection menu on the left displays all of the
available sets of data that can be graphed.  In particular, one can
graph the average, variance, standard deviation, or results from 
individual simulation runs.  For a top-level graph, these
data sets will be organized hierarchically.  Hierarchy is also 
introduced when simulations in an analysis view are given
simulation IDs or after performing an analysis while sweeping parameter
values.  After selecting a data set, one can select individual species to 
graph and how they are to be displayed.  In other words, for each 
species, there are the following options: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Use Check Box - Determines
whether or not this variable is displayed on the graph.  Checking or 
unchecking the box at the top changes the state for all variables in
the data set. 
\item Variable Label - The name displayed in the legend. 
\item Drop Down Menu Of Colors - The color that is used for this variable. 
\item Drop Down Menu Of Shapes - The shape that is used to mark the
  data points. 
\item Connect Check Box -
Determines whether to connect the points with a line. Checking or 
unchecking the box at the top changes the state for all variables in
the data set. 
\item Visible Check Box - Determines
whether shapes are visible on the line.  Checking or 
unchecking the box at the top changes the state for all variables in
the data set.
\item Fill Check Box - Determines whether shapes are filled
on the line.  Checking or 
unchecking the box at the top changes the state for all variables in
the data set.
\end{itemize}
Note that a check mark appears on a data set to indicate that some
variables have been selected in that data set.  Also, all variables can
be deselected by pressing the Deselect All button.

The ``Save Graph'' button saves the settings for the graph to 
a file, so when you re-open the graph, it will reload this data and display 
in the same way as before.  The ``Save As'' button prompts for a 
filename and creates a new top-level graph with that name.  
Finally, the ``Export'' button prompts for a filename and exports
the data to the given name.  The extension provided for the filename 
is used to determine how the graph is to be exported. The
supported file types are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item csv - comma separated value data file. 
\item dat - column separated data file. 
\item eps - encapsulated postscript. 
\item jpg - JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). 
\item pdf - portable document format.
\item png - portable network graphics. 
\item svg - scalable vector graphics.
\item tsd - time series data format (see Section~\ref{TSD}).
\end{itemize}
If no extension is given, then the file type is the one
specified in the file filter (default is pdf).  For image (i.e.,
not data) file types, you will be prompted to give a desired
pixel height and width for the file before the file is exported. 

\section{\label{Preferences}Preferences}

\noindent
User preferences can be set by selecting the {\tt Preferences} option
under the {\tt File} menu on Linux and Windows or the {\tt LEMA} 
menu on MacOS.  As shown below, the user can decided whether they wish
to use an external editor for VHDL-AMS models, and which editor to use.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{screenshots/preferenceLema} 
\end{center}

\section{\label{LHPN}Labeled Hybrid Petri Net Format}

\noindent
Our labeled hybrid Petri net (LHPN) format specifies a system according to an
extended version of Petri nets.  The graph is specified as a set of places and
transitions.  Each transition is described with a set of labels described in a
format specific to LHPNs.  The places, transitions, and boolean signals that are
general to Petri nets are described in a generalized .g file format, as follows.
Each space-delineated string on the lines ``.inputs'' and ``.outputs''
declares a boolean input or output signal.  Each space-delineated string on the
``.dummy'' line declares a ``dummy'' transition to be used in the net.
Beginning with the ``.graph'' line, each line with two space-delineated strings
represents a movement between a place and a transition.  The ``.marking'' line
ennumerates the initially marked places in the graph, and the ``.end'' line
specifies the end of the file.

\begin{verbatim}
.inputs a b
.outputs x y z
.dummy yP xM yM xP zP zM
.graph
ip0 yP
xM ip2
ip5 xM
etc.
.marking {ip4 ip5}
.end
\end{verbatim}

The labels and analog behavior of LHPNs is specified using a file format 
specific to LHPNs.  These lines will be interpreted as comments by other .g
parsers.  Each line used in the ATACS tool begins with a ``\#@.'' (citation for
ATACS?), while each line specific to the LEMA tool begins with a ``\#|.''.
Most of these lines are easily understood according to their beginning comments.
Each of the continuous and integer variables are declared in a space-delineated
``\#@.variables'' line included near the top of the file.  Following the 
variable declaration, the places are explicitly declared in a ``\#|.places'' 
line, which follows the format of the ``.inputs'' line.  The inital values of
the boolean signals are given in a boolean vector in a ``\#@.init\_state'' line
of the following format.  The signals are given in the order that they are
declared, input signals coming before output signals.

\begin{verbatim}
#@.init_state [boolean vector]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Each integer and continuous variable is given an initial value in a
``\#@.init\_vals'' line, and each continuous variable is given an initial rate
value in a ``\#@.init\_rates'' line.  The syntax of these lines is as follows,
the example being given for a ``.\#@init\_vals'' line.

\begin{verbatim}
#@.init_vals {<variable1=initial value1><variable2...>}
\end{verbatim}

The enabling condition for each transition is given in a ``\#@.enablings'' line
in the following format.

\begin{verbatim}
#@.enablings {<transition1=[enabling condition1]><transition2...>}
\end{verbatim}

The delay for each transition is specified in the ``\#@.delay\_assignments'' 
line according to the following format, where each lower and upper bound of the
delay is written as an expression parseable by ATACS.  Likewise, the delays may
be of a single value for deterministic behavior, as seen on the second 
transition.

\begin{verbatim}
#@.delay_assignments {<transition1=[lower bound, upper bound]><transition2=delay>}
\end{verbatim}

The assignments to boolean variables on each transition are specified in the
following format, where each lower and upper bound, or each deterministic
assignment, is also written as an expression.

\begin{verbatim}
#@.boolean_assigments {<transition1=[boolean1:=[lower bound, upper bound]][boolean2:=value]><transition2...>}
\end{verbatim}

Assignments to continuous variables and integers are combined onto a single
``\#@.assignments'' line and written  in the same format as boolean assignments.
It may be noted that the only explicit difference between the declaration of
continuous and integer variables in the inclusion of a ``\#@.continuous'' line
of the same format as the ``.input'' and ``.output'' lines.

\noindent
Below is a simple, but complete example of an LHPN, including each of the 
options mentioned above.

\begin{verbatim}
.inputs w x
.ouputs y z
.dummy t0 t1 t2
#@.variables a b c
#|.places p0 p1
#@.init_state [0011]
.graph
p0 t0
t0 p1
p1 t2
t2 p0
.marking {p0}
#@.init_vals {<a=0><b=3><c=[1,2]>}
#@.init_rates {<a=-2><b=1>}
#@.enablings {<t0=[~x&~y]><t1=[x&(a>=5)]><t2=[c>=4]>}
#@.assignments {<t1=[a:=5][c:=4]><t2=[c:=1]>}
#@.rate_assignments {<t0=[a:=1]><t2=[a:=0][b:=1]>}
#@.delay_assignments {<t0=2><t1=[0,inf]><t2=[0,5]>}
#@.boolean_assignments {<t0=[y:=TRUE]><t1=[y:=FALSE][z:=TRUE]><t2=[y:=~w]>}
#@.continuous a b
.end
\end{verbatim}

\section{\label{TSD}Time Series Data Format}

\noindent
The time series data (tsd) format is composed of a
parenthesized and comma-separated set of time points. Each time
point is composed of a parenthesized and comma-separated set of
data for that time point. This first time point is composed of a
set of strings that are the labels for the data entries. The
first entry in each time point is by convention the time for that
time point. Below is an example simulation of the species CI and
CII from 0 to 1000 seconds with time points separated by 100
seconds. 

(("time","CI","CII"), (0,0,0), (100,0,19), (200,20,25), (300,19,18),
(400,17,20), (500,17,46), \\
(600,26,40), (700,43,43), (800,63,28), (900,72,34), (1000,72,28))
