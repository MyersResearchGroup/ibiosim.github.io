2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Management</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A project is a collection of models, analysis views, learn
views, and graphs.  As shown below, <tt>iBioSim</tt> displays all project
files on the left, the open models, views, and graphs on the
right, and a log of all external commands on the bottom.
The menu bar is located on the top of the window in the Windows and
Linux versions.  It is located on the top of the screen in the MacOS version.

2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and Opening Projects</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To create a new project, select New &#8594; Project from the File
menu as shown below. You will then be prompted to browse to a desired location
and to give a name to the project directory. After you do this,
click the new button and a new project directory will be created.
To open a project, select Open &#8594; Project from the File menu.
You will then be prompted to browse to a project directory to
open, and clicking open will open the project. You may also open
a project by selecting one of your five most recently opened
projects by selecting the project name shown in the File drop
down menu shown below.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating Models and Graphs</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After you have created or opened a project, you can create a
new model or graph to add to the project.  To create a new 
Genetic Circuit Model (see Section&nbsp;), select 
New &#8594; Genetic Circuit Model from the
File menu as shown below. You will then be prompted to give a model id. At this
point, a GCM editor (see Section&nbsp;) will open in a new
tab. To create a new SBML model, select New &#8594; SBML Model
from the File menu. You will then be prompted to give a model id.
At this point, an SBML editor (see Section&nbsp;) will open
in a new tab. To create a new TSD graph, select New &#8594; TSD Graph
from the File menu. You will then be prompted to give a name to
the TSD graph.  At this point, a TSD graph editor (see Section&nbsp;)
will open in a new tab. To create a new probability graph, select 
New &#8594; Probability Graph from the File menu. You will then
be prompted to give a name to the probability graph. At this point, a 
probability graph editor (see Section&nbsp;)
will open in a new tab. Once a model or graph is created, it can
be opened again later by right clicking on the object in the
project window and selecting "Edit", or alternatively
double-clicking on the object.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Importing Models</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can import into the current working project GCMs
or SBML Models created by other programs or stored in other projects. 
To import a GCM, select Import &#8594; Genetic Circuit Model
from the File menu as shown below. You will then be able to browse to
find a model to import.  After  selecting the desired model, click the 
import button
to bring the GCM into the project.  Before bringing the model into the 
project, it will be checked to see if it is a valid GCM file.
To import an SBML model, the procedure is the same except use the 
Import &#8594; SBML Model option.  Before bringing the model
into the project, it will be checked to see if it a valid SBML file.  
The model will also be checked for consistency, and any errors or
warnings will be reported.  These should be corrected before analysis 
of the model is performed.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing Project Objects</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All project objects can be modified by highlighting the object
and using a right mouse click to open a menu of options as shown
below. Using this menu, every type of object can be copied, renamed, or
deleted. For a GCM, the "View/Edit" option opens the
model in a GCM editor (see Section&nbsp;). For an SBML model,
the "View/Edit" option opens the model in an SBML editor 
(see Section&nbsp;). For a TSD graph, the "View/Edit" 
option opens the TSD graph in a TSD graph editor (see Section&nbsp;). 
For a probability graph, the "View/Edit" option opens
the probability graph in a probability graph editor 
(see Section&nbsp;). 
For an analysis view, the "Open Analysis View" option opens the
analysis view (see Section&nbsp;). For a learn view, the
"Open Learn View" option opens the learn view (see Section&nbsp;).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A GCM can also be viewed using 
<A HREF="http://www.graphviz.org/">
GraphViz's
</A>
dotty program  by right clicking on the model you want to view and
selecting the "View Genetic Circuit" option. 
There are two additional ways to view an SBML model. You
can either select the "View Network" option or the
"View in Browser" option.  The "View Network"
option converts the model to a GraphViz file and then will open that 
file with GraphViz's dotty program.  The "View in Browser" option 
coverts the model to an xhtml file and opens that file with your 
default xhtml browser.

To perform analysis or learning, right click on a model and
select "Create Analysis View" (see Section&nbsp;)
to perform analysis or "Create Learn View" (see Section&nbsp;)
to perform learning. You will then be prompted to give a name to
your analysis or learn view. After a name is entered, a tab with
the newly created view will open. Once a view is created, it can
be opened again later by right clicking on an analysis directory
and selecting "Open Analysis/Learn View" or alternatively
double-clicking on the view.

When you create an analysis view from a GCM, an SBML model is
automatically created for simulation and analysis. Within the
analysis view, you can edit the initial concentrations and
parameters. However, if you wish to be able to edit the
structure, you should first create an SBML model using Create
SBML Model option in the right click menu or the Save as SBML button in
the GCM Editor (see Section&nbsp;).  You can then open and
edit this model using an SBML editor (see Section&nbsp;) and
create an analysis view from this edited model.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">

</a>SBML Editor</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The SBML editor as shown below allows the user to create or modify an SBML
model of a biochemical reaction network.  An SBML model includes
compartments (see Section&nbsp;), 
species (see Section&nbsp;),
reactions (see Section&nbsp;), 
parameters (see Section&nbsp;),
function definitions (see Section&nbsp;), 
unit definitions (see Section&nbsp;), 
compartment types (see Section&nbsp;), 
species types (see Section&nbsp;),
initial assignments (see Section&nbsp;), 
rules (see Section&nbsp;), 
constraints (see Section&nbsp;), and
events (see Section&nbsp;).
Each of these items can be added, removed, or edited. 
To add a new item, click on the appropriate add button. You
will then be prompted to provide a unique id and some properties
for this new item (as described below). After you have filled out
all of the required fields, click add and the new item will be
added to the SBML model.
To remove an item from the model, select that item and click
the remove button. The item will then be removed from the model.
However, if you try to remove an item that is being used 
(for example, a species that is used in a reaction), you will first have 
to remove its use.
To edit an existing item, select that item from the list and
click the edit button. An editing window will open and you will
be able to change the properties of that item. When you are done
editing this item, click save to save the changes to the item. 
After the model is complete, press the Save SBML button to store
the model.  The Save and Check SBML button also saves the model, but
in this case it also checks the models consistency.
Note that many checks are done on the fly, so it should be difficult
to create models with consistency problems.  However, if a user does
not wish to be warned about undeclared units or does not wish to have
units checked at all can set preferences to turn this off
(see Section&nbsp;).  The Save and Check SBML button
though will still present all the unit warnings and errors.
Finally, the Save As button can also be used to store the
model, but in this case, a new model ID will be requested and the
model will be saved using that ID.

3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="SBMLMath">
</a>SBML Math Formulas</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Math formulas appear in many SBML constructs.  These formulas are 
expressed as text strings using a simple C-like syntax. 
SBML math formulas can include: 

<ul>
<li> Variables (compartment, species, parameter IDs, and reaction IDs)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Real Numbers
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Built-in constants: exponentiale, pi, true, and false.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Special variable time or t which returns the current simulation time.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Mathematical operators including add (+), subtract (-), multiply
  (*), divide (/), and power (x^y) which is equivalent to pow(x,y).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> A function defined in the list of function definitions.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Logical functions: and, or, xor, not.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Relational functions: eq, neq, geq, gt, leq, and lt.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Unary functions: abs, ceiling, exp, factorial, floor, ln, log,
  sqr, and sqrt.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Trigonometric functions: cos, cosh, sin, sinh, tan, tanh, cot,
  coth, csc, csch, sec, sech, arccos, arccosh, arcsin, arcsinh,
  arctan, arctanh, arccot, arccoth, arccsc, arccsch, arcsec, and arcsech.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The delay(expr1,expr2) function which returns the value of expr1 at a time
      expr2 time units earlier (not currently supported by analysis).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The piecewise(value1, case1, value2, case2, ..., otherwise)
  function returns value1 if case1 is true, value2 if case2 is true,
  etc.  If no cases are true, it returns otherwise value.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>iBioSim</tt>'s simulators also support several random functions which
are added by default to any SBML file created with its SBML editor.  
The following random functions, therefore, can also be used in SBML
math formula:

<ul>
<li> Continuous random functions: uniform(a,b), normal(m,s), exponential(mu), 
  gamma(a,b), lognormal(z,s), chisq(nu), laplace(a), cauchy(a), and 
  rayleigh(s).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Discrete random functions: poisson(mu), binomial(p,n), and bernoulli(p).
<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Reactions are used to create or destroy molecular species in a
biochemical reaction network.  As shown below, a 
reaction is composed of the following:

<ul>
<li> ID: a unique ID composed only of alphanumeric characters and 
       underscores.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Name: an arbitrary string description (optional).

<li> Reversible: a Boolean indicating if the reaction is reversible
       (default=false).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Fast: a Boolean indicating if the reaction is fast (default=false).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> List of Reactants: species that are consumed by this reaction.
<div class="p"><!----></div>

<li> List of Products: species that are produced by this reaction.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> List of Modifiers: species that are neither produced or consumed 
       by this reaction.
<div class="p"><!----></div>

<li> Kinetic law: an SBML math formula (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>)
       describing the rate or probability for this reaction.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>
When adding a reactant or product, the user must specify a species ID and 
the stoichiometry (i.e., the number of molecules produced or consumed by the
reaction).  The stoichiometry can also be expressed as a stoichiometry math
formula.  Each parameter is composed of an ID, Name, Value, and Units.
The list of parameters begins with a default forward
reaction rate (kf) and reverse reaction rate (kr). These names
and their values should likely be edited. The kinetic law can
either be automatically generated using the Use Mass Action
button or manually entered.  The
"Use Mass Action" button creates a rate law using the
law of mass action. It assumes that the first parameter in the
list is the forward reaction rate and the second parameter in the
list is the reverse reaction rate.  
The "Clear" button clears the kinetic law editor. 
The stoichiometry math and kinetic law formulas can only include
those species that appear as reactants, products, or modifiers.

names which are arguments to the function.  While functions can
call other functions, they cannot be recursive (i.e., call themselves) 
either directly or indirectly (i.e., through a cycle of function calls).
As mentioned earlier, several random functions supported by

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <tt>Initial Assignments/Rules/Constraints/Events</tt> 
tab as shown below allows users to provide initial assignments 
(see Section&nbsp;), 
rules (see Section&nbsp;),

</a>Initial Assignments</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Initial assignments as shown below are used to provide an SBML math formula 
(see Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>) that is evaluated at time 0 to determine 
the initial value of a compartment size, species amount or
concentration, or parameter.  The value of this formula takes precedence over
the initial value specified in the object.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc3.4.2">
3.4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="rules">
</a>Rules</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are three types of rules: algebraic, assignment, and rate rules
which are in the following form:

<center>

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center">Algebraic  </td><td align="center">left-hand side is zero             </td><td align="center">0 = f(W) </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Assignment </td><td align="center">left-hand side is a scalar         </td><td align="center">x = f(W) </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Rate       </td><td align="center">left-hand side is a rate-of-change </td><td align="center">[dx/dt] = f(W) 
</td></tr></table>

</center>
Algebraic rules specify relationships which must be maintained 
(not currently supported by analysis).  Assignment rules specify 
the value of a compartment size, species amount or concentration, or
parameter in terms of an SBML math formula (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>).  A variable cannot be determined by
both an assignment rule and initial assignment.  Rate rules specify
the rate of change of a compartment size, species amount or
concentration, or parameter in terms of an SBML math formula
(see Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>).  A variable cannot be determined 
by both an assignment rule and a rate rule.  A species that is 
a reactant or a product of any reaction cannot be updated by either
an assignment rule or rate rule.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When adding a rule, the user first selects the type of rule as shown
below.  This
will automatically restrict the set of variables available for the 
left-hand side to those that are valid.  The user should then select
a variable, and enter an SBML math formula (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>)
for the rule.  When editing a rule, the user cannot modify the rule type.

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc3.4.3">
3.4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="constraints">
</a>Constraints</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Constraints are used to specify properties that should cause
simulation to terminate.  Our analysis method can provide histograms 
that show the proportion of simulations that are terminated due to each
possible constraint.  As shown below, 
each constraint is composed of an ID which is
used to identify it in these histograms, a constraint given as an 
SBML math formula (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>), and a message 
describing the constraint.  A default id is automatically generated 
when a new constraint is created.

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc3.4.4">
3.4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="events">
</a>Events</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Events are used to specify discrete changes of compartment sizes, 
species amounts or concentrations, and parameter values.  
As shown below, each event 
is composed of an ID, an optional name, a trigger formula, an optional
delay formula, and a list of event assignments.  When adding a new
event, a default ID is provided.  The behavior of an event is that during 
each simulation cycle, the trigger formula is evaluated.  If it was false
in the previous simulation cycle, and it is now evaluating to true,
the event is scheduled to occur at a time in the future specified by 
the delay formula or immediately if no delay formula is provided.  
It should be noted that since the trigger value must change from false
to true, no event is scheduled if the trigger evaluates to true at the 
start of simulation.  When an event occurs, it executes all the event 
assignments.  Each event assignment sets a compartment size, species 
amount or concentration, or parameter value to the value specified by
the SBML math formula (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#SBMLMath">3.1</a>) provided with the event
assignment.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">

</a>GCM Editor</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The GCM editor shown below allows the user to create or modify a GCM 
(see Section&nbsp;).  A GCM is a compact graphical representation 
of a genetic circuit which can later be synthesized into an SBML model. 
A GCM includes promoters (see Section&nbsp;),
GCM species (see Section&nbsp;), 
influences (see Section&nbsp;), 
GCM parameters (see Section&nbsp;), and an optional
SBML file.  GCM species, influences, 
and promoters can be added, removed, or edited. Parameters can only be edited. 
An SBML file can also be selected to merge with the SBML generated from a GCM.
This allows either customization of the SBML model or the addition of SBML
constructs such as Initial Assignments, Rules, Constraints, 
and Events (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#InitRuleConstEvent">3.4</a>).

<center>
<img src="screenshots/GCMedit.png" alt="screenshots/GCMedit.png" />
</center>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To add a new item to the GCM, click on the appropriate add button. You
will then be prompted to input information regarding the new
item. After you have filled out the required fields, click on ok
and the new item will be added into the GCM.
To remove an item from the GCM, select that item and click the
remove button. The item will then be removed from the GCM.
However, if you try to remove species or promoters that are used in
an influence, you will first have to remove the influence in
order to remove the species or promoter from the model.
To edit an existing item, select that item from the list and
click the edit button. An editing window will open and you will
be able to change the properties of that item. When you are done
editing this item, click save to save the changes to the item. 
To merge an existing SBML file with the GCM output, click on
the SBML file and select the SBML file to use. This will merge
the contents of the selected SBML file with the SBML file that is 
generated from the GCM.  Finally, there are two abstractions that can
be selected to be performed when generating SBML, the biochemical and
dimerization abstractions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once a GCM is completed, the user can save the GCM or save the GCM 
using a new name.  The user can also save the GCM as SBML which creates
an SBML file of the same name as the GCM.  Finally, the user can save
an SBML template which creates a blank SBML file with the same species 
as the GCM.  This is useful for creating an SBML file which will be 
attached to the GCM, and includes rules, constraints, or events.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="Promoters">
</a>Promoters</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Promoters are special species which represent the region of the DNA
from which transcription is initiated.  
When adding or editing promoters, the user must supply a unique ID.  
An optional name can also be provided which is an arbitrary string
description for the promoter. 
If desired, the user can then modify the initial promoter count (ng), 
the RNAP binding equilibrium (Ko), 
the open complex production rate (ko), 
the stoichiometry of production (i.e., the number of transcripts 
per mRNA, np), the basal production rate (kb), or
the activated production rate (ka).

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="GCMSpecies">
</a>GCM Species</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GCM species are the molecules (usually proteins) produced by genes. 
When adding or editing a species, the user must provide a unique ID. 
The user can also select the type of the species to be normal, constant, 
or unconstrained.
A normal species will result in gene production and degradation reactions
being produced.  A constant species will not generate any
production or degradation reactions.  An unconstrained species will
produce a constant production and degradation reaction.
The user can also specify an initial species count (ns), a 
Dimerization equilibrium (Kd), and a degradation rate (kd).

<center>
<img src="screenshots/GCMspecies.png" alt="screenshots/GCMspecies.png" />
</center>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.3">
4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="Influences">
</a>Influences</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Influences describe the relationships between the GCM species.
When adding or editing an influence, the user must select an
input and output species, as well as the type of influence. If
the type is repression, then the input species represses the
production of the output species. If the type is activation, then
the input species activates the production of the output species.
The user can also specify whether the influence has a promoter.
If a promoter is selected, then this groups all influences using
the same promoter together. 

<center>
<img src="screenshots/influence.png" alt="screenshots/influence.png" />
</center>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, if there are two influences:<br />
A &#8722;&#124; C, Promoter P1<br />
B &#8722;&#124; C, Promoter P2<br />
this will create two reactions, where in the presence of A and
B, C is repressed.  This would behave roughly like a NAND gate. 
If, on the other hand, there are two influences:<br />
A &#8722;&#124; C, Promoter P1<br />
B &#8722;&#124; C, Promoter P1<br />
this creates one reaction, where in the presence of A or
B, C is repressed.  This would behave roughly like a NOR gate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Users can also specify if the influence is a biochemical
influence.  A biochemical influence requires all input species
belonging to the same promoter to be present in order to affect
transcription. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, if there are two biochemical influences:<br />
A +&#124; C, Promoter P1<br />
B +&#124; C, Promoter P1<br />
this will create two reactions, A and B combines into a
complex, and the complex represses the production of C. This is a
NAND gate. If, on the other hand, if biochemical is not selected,
this behaves as a NOR gate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The user can also set the value for degree of cooperativity (nc) 
which is the number of binding sites for transcription factors. 
The N-mer as transcription factor (nd) field determines how many 
monomers of the input species
must be bound together in order to affect transcription.  The user
can also set the value of the repression or activation binding equilibrium
(Kr and Ka).  Finally, the user can specify the biochemical equilibrium
(Kb).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.4">
4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="GCMParameters">
</a>GCM Parameters</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GCM parameters are a list of global parameters that are used
when generating the SBML model for the GCM.  The parameter list
allows the user an easy way to change all the parameter values in
a convenient location.  If a parameter in the GCM is set to
default, it will use the value found in the GCM parameter list.  
These defaults can be modified in the user preferences
(see Section&nbsp;).  The GCM parameters are listed below:

iBioSim comes with a number of simulation methods, ranging
from continuous-deterministic simulation methods to
discrete-stochastic simulation methods. In order to perform
efficient temporal behavior analysis, various model abstraction
can also be automatically applied.  These routines are implemented
within the reb2sac tool described in

The first set of radio buttons in this tab specifies the
levels of abstraction. "None" means to use no abstraction,
"Abstraction" means to perform reaction-based abstraction, and
"Logical Abstraction" means to perform both reaction-based and
logical abstractions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The second set of radio buttons specify the type of analysis.
"ODE" is for continuous-deterministic simulation,
"Monte Carlo" is for discrete-stochastic simulation,
"Markov" performs temporal probability distribution
analysis on finite-state Markov chain models, "sbml"
outputs the model in SBML format, "Network" outputs the
structure of the model in the GraphViz format for display by dotty, 
"Browser" outputs the model in xhtml format for display
in a web browswer.

</a>Parameter Editor</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The parameter editor as shown below is similar in form to the SBML editor,
but it only allows initial concentrations and parameters to be
adjusted. Each of these parameters starts with the original value
specified in the SBML or GCM associated with
this analysis view. By changing the type to "Custom", a
new value can be entered. Changing the type back to "Original",
restores the original value. These values can also be swept by
selecting the "Sweep" type. In this case, you should
provide a start value, a stop value, a step amount, and a level
(1 or 2). When analyzing using sweep parameters, one analysis run
is produced for each value stepped through from start to stop.
The parameters at level 2 are changed first. When they have all
reached their stop value, the parameters at level 1 are stepped
once, and the parameters at level 2 are stepped through again.
This process repeats until all parameters at level 1 have stepped
to their stop value.

10</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="GCM">
</a>Genetic Circuit Model Format</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our genetic circuit model (gcm) format specifies a genetic
circuit using the same format used by the GraphViz graph drawing
tool.  The vertices in the graph are the species in
the genetic circuit, and the edges in the graph represent the
activation and repression relationships between the species. An
activation relationship is shown with a blue (blue4) arrow (vee)
and a repression relationship is shown with a red (firebrick4)
tee. The label field in the species declaration is the name of
the species. The arrowhead field in the relationship declaration
represents the type of relationship between the species.
Repression is labeled with a tee and activation is labeled with a
vee. The label field in the relationship declaration represents
how many molecules are necessary to activate or repress the
production of the species. An example is shown below for a simple
genetic circuit in which the species CI represses CII while CII
activates CI production. The s1 &#8722; &gt;  s2 edge has a label field of
"2" which means two molecules of CI are required to form a dimer 
to repress CII. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
digraph&nbsp;G&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;CI&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="CI"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;CII&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="CII"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;CII&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;CI&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=vee];
&nbsp;&nbsp;CI&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;CII&nbsp;[color="firebrick4",label="2",arrowhead=tee];
}

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
More advanced behavior can be modeled by using extra fields.
The promoter field groups a set of species together. The examples
below shows how the promoter field works. In the genetic circuit
model below, species A represses the production of species B and
C, independently. If there was exactly 1 molecule of species A,
it would only be able to repress production of species B or C,
but not both. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
digraph&nbsp;G&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="A"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="B"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="C"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee];
}&nbsp;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With the promoter field, one species A now represses the
promoter "P1", which produces both species B and C.
This means that one molecule of species A will repress the
production of both species B and C. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
digraph&nbsp;G&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="A"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="B"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="C"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee,promoter="P1"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee,promoter="P1"];
}

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The promoter field can also be used to separate production
reactions. In the example below, both species A and B can repress
the production of species C. If either is present, then very
little C will be produced. This behavior is like a NOR gate. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
digraph&nbsp;G&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="A"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="B"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="C"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee];
}&nbsp;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
However, if there needs to be two different sources of
production for species C, the promoter field can be used to
accomplish this. In the example below, A represses the production
of C by binding to the P1 promoter, and B represses the
production of C by binding to the P2 promoter. Both A and B need
to be present to fully repress the level of C. If either is at a
low level, then the level of C will be high. This behavior is
like a NAND gate. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
digraph&nbsp;G&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="A"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="B"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="C"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee,promoter="P1"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=tee,promoter="P2"];
}

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The example below shows how to model an AND gate. The species
A and B have the constant flag set to true. This means that A and
B have no production and degradation reactions. The reactions
contain a promoter label "P1". This means that the
species C can be activated by both A and B. Combined with the
type flag of biochemical, this creates a biochemical reaction
where species A and B combine together to form a complex to
activate production of species C. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
digraph&nbsp;G&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="A",const=true];
&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="B",const=true];
&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[shape=ellipse,color=black,label="C"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;C&nbsp;[color="blue4",arrowhead=vee,promoter="P1",type=biochemical];
